                    The ironical truth is the awareness of light importance, yet the limited actions to deliver. Let’s explore
                    about architectural lighting with digital media systems and sustainable technology for hospitality.
                    Architecture and space design creates a interactive experience for all ages. New technologies represent a
                    value for the economy, supporting user experience in the hospitality journey. Interior design for every hotel
                    exclaims the brand identity in its own unique style. Lighting here can play dual roles - function and design.
                    The design of decorative lights sets the mood for all spaces. From industrial pendants to delicate flowing
                    patterns or minimal sleek solutions, the space often dominated by interior design experts and off the shelves
                    light sellers. The second role come into action in the form of architectural lighting. The crucial and
                    intelligent use of light to support material design and space function. From beam angles to delivered lumens,
                    relative lighting and contrast are crucial parameters.

                <p className="itext-wrapper-14">
                    Space experience is influenced by lighting design, and integrating natural light is the perfect starting
                    point. Identification of interior and exterior details is necessary to separate hot lights and soft lights.
                    Soft lights complement the morning freshness for breakfast and evening warmth for dinners, while hot lights
                    add to contrast and differentiation of primary and secondary spaces, adding to an overall personalised
                    experience. Rooms are a bit tricky, often tagged as spaces with boring, flat and insufficient lighting.
                    Integrating layers of light with pre-set themes to support every user demand can be good way to resolve the
                    ancient mystery of poor lighting in hotel rooms. Transitional spaces, such as corridors, lounges or even
                    fitness areas play its own role in building the overall visitor experience in a hotel. From short coffee
                    moments to long workouts, lighting should support space function and complement its design. The influence of
                    indirect lighting in these areas can be very impactful.

                <p className="itext-wrapper-15">
                    Taking inspirations from geographical highlights can do wonders in creating exotic atmospheres. A smart
                    example is the Icehotel in Sweden, Kiruna, handsculpted in 1989, a must-see in the bucket list for tourists
                    and locals. Worldwide known to be the biggest hotel of ice and snow, it is a combination of ice rooms and
                    elegant art suites, churches, decorations by local artists, all made of ice. Snow and ice are taken from Torne
                    River, nearby. All in 2100 square meter. You can also attend a course on Scandivian cuisine. If you are ready
                    to leave in a -5 °C (23 °F), between December and April, feel welcome.

                    Decorative lighting in hospitality comes first. In order, the prime element to consider is the entrance to
                    impress visitors (chandeliers for example); the check-in point with decorative lighting lamps; bright and
                    indirect light and soft tones functional to the small size of bathroom; optimal lighting in the corridors to
                    facilitate the orientation of the guests (vitally important for outdoors pools and garden as well, with floor
                    lamps).
